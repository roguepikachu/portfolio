# Optimization Techniques for Large-Scale Machine Learning Models

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of optimization techniques for training large-scale machine learning models with limited computational resources. We analyze various approaches including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, and propose a novel hybrid optimization framework that combines these methods for maximum efficiency.

## Introduction
As machine learning models grow in size and complexity, training and deploying them becomes increasingly challenging, especially with limited computational resources. This paper explores various optimization techniques that address this challenge.
