# Vehicle Detection from Aerial Imagery Using PCA and Deep Learning

## Overview

This study explores the challenge of detecting small vehicles in aerial images by combining classical dimensionality reduction techniques with modern deep learning architectures. Unlike conventional pipelines that struggle with image clutter, overlapping patterns, and scale variability, this work introduces Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step to simplify the feature space. The reduced-dimensionality data is then processed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with particular emphasis on ResNet50 and MobileNetv1.

The central goal is to improve detection precision without incurring heavy computational cost, particularly in scenarios where vehicles occupy a small fraction of the image and where visual ambiguity from building features, shadows, or terrain can lead to misclassification. This pipeline is validated using the publicly available VEDAI dataset, which offers a diverse and realistic benchmark for small-object aerial detection.

## Motivation

Vehicle detection from aerial imagery plays a pivotal role in numerous civilian and military applications, from traffic monitoring and urban planning to surveillance and autonomous navigation. However, detecting small targets like vehicles presents a unique set of challenges: they can appear visually similar to surrounding structures, their spatial footprint is minimal, and environmental conditions such as occlusion and shadow can alter their visual profile.

Existing CNN-based detectors often falter in such contexts due to their limited ability to focus on subtle, yet discriminative features within a noisy background. Additionally, many deep models are either computationally expensive or not optimized for sparse object detection in large-resolution images. This research investigates whether PCA can be used to reduce data dimensionality while retaining key semantic information, thereby simplifying the learning task and reducing false detections.

## Dataset and Preprocessing

The dataset used in this work is VEDAI (Vehicle Detection in Aerial Imagery), a benchmark corpus comprising RGB and infrared images collected from a variety of rural and urban locations. Each image is 512x512 pixels, annotated with bounding boxes across multiple vehicle classes.

Prior to training, each image undergoes grayscale conversion to make it compatible with PCA. The image is then flattened into a 1D vector and mean-centered. PCA is applied to extract approximately 100 principal components that preserve the most informative variance across images. This transformation not only reduces computational overhead but also suppresses redundant or misleading features—an important consideration when working with high-resolution aerial scenes where distractions are common.

## Methodology

The detection framework consists of two major phases: training and inference. During training, vehicle and non-vehicle samples are manually extracted from the dataset and labeled. Feature extraction is then performed on each sample using PCA, and these features are used to train two CNN architectures: MobileNetv1 and ResNet50.

Inference is carried out by applying Canny edge detection to test images in order to identify potential object regions. These regions are cropped and classified using the trained CNNs. Bounding boxes are then drawn around positively identified vehicles, completing the detection process.

What sets this pipeline apart is its deliberate integration of dimensionality reduction before learning. PCA not only speeds up training and reduces noise, but it also enhances generalization by preventing the model from overfitting to irrelevant spatial details that are often abundant in aerial images.

## Model Architectures

Two well-known CNN architectures were examined. MobileNetv1 is a lightweight network optimized for mobile and edge inference. Its performance is constrained by the absence of skip connections, making it vulnerable to vanishing gradients and poor learning in deep layers. ResNet50, in contrast, employs residual connections to preserve gradient flow across layers. This architecture proves especially beneficial for vehicle detection, where small features must be preserved throughout the network's depth.

Both networks are trained using the PCA-transformed data, and their performance is compared both with and without PCA preprocessing to evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction.

## Experimental Results and Insights

The empirical evaluation demonstrates a clear advantage of PCA-enhanced training. Without PCA, both networks suffer from high misclassification rates. For example, in unprocessed images, rooftop structures like chimneys were frequently mistaken for vehicles. Applying PCA to the data before training led to a significant drop in these false positives.

MobileNetv1 achieved a detection accuracy of approximately 76.25%, showing improvement when PCA was applied. However, ResNet50 consistently outperformed MobileNetv1, reaching an accuracy of 85.2% when PCA was used—a 6% improvement over its non-PCA counterpart and nearly 20% better than traditional handcrafted feature-based methods such as HOG and SVD.

These findings underscore the value of combining statistical and deep learning methods in vision tasks where conventional pipelines might struggle with noise, redundancy, or small object detection.

## Discussion

One of the key takeaways is that PCA, despite being a classical technique, remains highly relevant when used intelligently with modern neural networks. It provides a controlled way to reduce feature complexity, especially in domains like aerial vision where images are information-dense but sparsely annotated. 

Another insight relates to model architecture. Residual connections play a critical role in maintaining feature integrity during deep learning. Their absence in MobileNetv1 likely contributed to its lower performance, reinforcing the need for architectural elements that preserve spatial gradients, especially when detecting subtle targets.

## Limitations and Future Work

While effective, this study leaves several areas open for improvement. The grayscale conversion required for PCA discards valuable chromatic cues, which could be useful for distinguishing vehicles from similar-looking background features. Incorporating PCA-compatible color-preserving transformations or using dimensionality reduction methods suited for multi-channel input (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) could be explored.

Moreover, infrared (IR) data from the VEDAI dataset was not used in this experiment but offers potential for improving performance in low-visibility scenarios. Future work could include fusing RGB and IR modalities to improve robustness. The authors also propose experimenting with transfer learning on datasets from different geographies and exploring lighter models for real-time deployment.
