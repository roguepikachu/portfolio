# Optimization Techniques for Large-Scale Machine Learning Models

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of optimization techniques for training large-scale machine learning models with limited computational resources. We analyze various approaches including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, and propose a novel hybrid optimization framework that combines these methods for maximum efficiency.

## Introduction
As machine learning models grow in size and complexity, training and deploying them becomes increasingly challenging, especially with limited computational resources. This paper explores various optimization techniques that address this challenge.

## Methodology
Our study evaluates different optimization techniques across various model architectures and datasets. We measure performance in terms of accuracy, inference time, and memory footprint.

## Results
The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid optimization framework achieves a 3.5x reduction in model size and a 2.7x improvement in inference speed while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the original model.

## Conclusion
Our findings suggest that combining multiple optimization techniques in a principled manner can significantly improve the efficiency of large-scale machine learning models without substantial loss in performance.
