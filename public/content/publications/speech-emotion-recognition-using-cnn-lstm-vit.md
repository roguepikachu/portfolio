## Abstract
Investigating the application of attention-based deep learning techniques for speech emotion recognition (SER). We compare two major approaches: CNN-LSTM and Mel Spectrogram-Vision Transformer models against existing benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning-based feature extraction strategies, eliminating the need for handpicked features required by traditional machine learning classifiers. The CNN-LSTM model achieved 88.50% accuracy while the Vision Transformer approach achieved 85.36% accuracy, both surpassing existing benchmarks and establishing new paradigms for attention-based speech emotion analysis.

## Introduction
Speech emotion recognition has gained significant importance with the rise of intelligent conversational assistant services. Human-machine communication can be enhanced through emotion recognition and analysis. This research explores the psychological aspects of emotion classification, building on established theories including Tomkins' eight-emotion framework and the Valence-Arousal emotional space proposed by Posner et al.

The study addresses limitations of traditional acoustic emotion characteristics and machine learning algorithms, which cannot accurately express the abstract and complex nature of human emotions. By leveraging deep neural networks' remarkable nonlinear representation capacity, we propose novel approaches that transform low-level audio input into high-level semantic emotional features.

## Applications and Impact

The integration of deep learning architectures such as CNN-LSTM and Vision Transformers in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) opens up transformative possibilities across various real-world domains. By effectively recognizing and interpreting human emotions from speech signals, these models enable more empathetic and responsive systems.

**Practical Applications**

Speech Emotion Recognition has a growing footprint in industries that rely on human interaction and emotional intelligence:

* **Conversational AI**: Emotion-aware systems can enhance human-computer interaction by adjusting responses based on the user's emotional state, leading to more natural and meaningful conversations.
* **Healthcare**: In therapeutic settings, SER can support emotion monitoring to assist psychologists in tracking patient moods over time, potentially flagging depressive or anxious speech patterns early.
* **Customer Service**: Call centers benefit from real-time sentiment analysis, enabling automated systems to escalate calls to human agents when negative emotions are detected.
* **Education**: Emotion-adaptive learning systems can tailor educational content delivery by responding to students’ frustration or enthusiasm, improving engagement and outcomes.

These applications underscore how SER can shift machines from passive listeners to emotionally aware participants in communication.
