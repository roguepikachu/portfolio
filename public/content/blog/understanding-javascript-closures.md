# Understanding JavaScript Closures

Closures are one of the most powerful and fundamental concepts in JavaScript. They allow functions to access variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has returned.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and the inner function references variables from the outer function's scope.

```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  // This is the outer function's scope
  
  function innerFunction(y) {
    // This inner function has access to 'x'
    return x + y;
  }
  
  return innerFunction;
}

const add5 = outerFunction(5);
console.log(add5(3)); // 8
```

## Why Closures Matter

Closures enable powerful programming patterns like:
- Data privacy and encapsulation
- Function factories
- Module patterns
- Event handlers with persistent state

Understanding closures is essential for mastering JavaScript and writing effective code.
