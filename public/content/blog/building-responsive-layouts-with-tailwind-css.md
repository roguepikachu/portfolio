# Building Responsive Layouts with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS makes building responsive layouts incredibly straightforward with its mobile-first approach and intuitive breakpoint system.

## Responsive Breakpoints

Tailwind uses a mobile-first breakpoint system:

```css
/* Mobile first approach */
.container {
  @apply w-full px-4;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@screen md {
  .container {
    @apply max-w-4xl mx-auto;
  }
}

/* Desktop and up */
@screen lg {
  .container {
    @apply max-w-6xl;
  }
}
```

## Grid Layouts

Creating responsive grids is simple with Tailwind:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">Item 1</div>
  <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">Item 2</div>
  <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

This creates a single column on mobile, two columns on tablet, and three columns on desktop.

## Best Practices

1. Always start with mobile design
2. Use consistent spacing scales
3. Test across different screen sizes
4. Leverage Tailwind's built-in responsive utilities

Tailwind CSS empowers developers to create responsive designs efficiently while maintaining clean, readable code.
